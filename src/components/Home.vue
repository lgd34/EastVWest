    <p><i>The light was departing. The brown air drew down
     all the earthâ€™s creatures, calling them to rest
     from their day-roving, as I, one man alone,
     prepared myself to face the double war
     of the journey and the pity, which memory
     shall here set down, nor hesitate, nor err.</i><br>- Inferno</p>
