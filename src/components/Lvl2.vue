      <p class="westp">It's the second circle of hell where the punishment truly begins.  This circle punishes those overcome by
        the sin of lust.  Their punishment is fitting for their crime, as they've let their carnal desires control and push them
        aimlessly through life, violent winds push their souls aimlessly here, depriving the souls of any sense of stability or rest.

      <img id="minos" src="..\assets\img\2minos.jpg" alt="Minos">
      <p class="westp">The supreme judge of the underworld, Minos guards the second cirlce of hell and is charged with sentencing each soul to it's proper punishment in
        hell.  To indicate which circle a soul is assigned, he wraps his tail around his arm that many times.  Functionally speaking, 
        his purpose is similar to the first court in the Chinese rendition of hell.

      <p class="westp">In this court the deeds of all individuals are recorded, the good, bad and everything in between.  These behaviors, intentions
        and thoughts can result in rewards or punishments respectively in the lives of those being recorded.  This means that the juristication of
        those who run hell isn't limited to the afterlife, but the earthly world as well.

        joyously introduces life into the world while the Northern in simliar glee ends those lives when the time comes.

         misery, all men hate him, while happiness and good fortune flee him, and evil stars torment him. When his hundred-day units are
