      <p class="westp">Souls are punished for greed in the fourth circle of hell.  Here, two factions battle
        for all eternity, those who've hoarded their wealth through life, and those who lavishly wasted it, jousting
        with massive bags of money that they push with their chests.  So occupied by this activity, the souls here have 
        lost all sense of individuality and don't even acknowledge Dante when he enters this circle.  Addionally, during
        his visit Dante witnesses both clergymen and popes among the combatants, implying that the corruption of greed 
        has even inflitrated the highest levels of the church.

        again, again they cried their chant of scorn;<br>

      <p class="westp">Much like the third court, various types of punishments inflicted upon souls here as well.  In
        this scroll, dishonest merchants, burglars, and cheaters are punished through crucifixion, sawing, rebirth as
        an animal, and drowning.  Also similarly to the previous scroll, there's little sense of a greater organization,
        with the exception of merchants being hung from steel hooks, none of the punishments are particular exclusive
        to a particular crime, nor is there any particular theme that emcompasses the crimes punished within this court.
      </p>
      <h3>River of Futility</h3>
      <p class="westp">The scroll also depicts the River of Futility towards the bottom.  In Mulian's journey to rescue
        his mother, this river is presented as uncrossable for those who have commited misdeeds in life.  Those trapped by
        the river beg Mulian that he tells their children that "If you want to end our torment and suffering.  Nothing is 
        better than works of charity to save lost souls".
